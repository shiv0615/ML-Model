* Python classes written to encapsulate different functions within modules
* Main.py is the driver script that describes the workflow in a seamless manner.
    The names of the functions and modules are self explanatory
    Functions calls in Main.py should make workflow transparent
    Input section requires path to the file and then you can hit run to generate the plots shown in the ppt
